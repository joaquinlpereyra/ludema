  "body": "# What is Ludema? \r\n\r\nLudema is a library intended to help beginner and intermediate programmers create terminal games. The project was started specifically with beginners in mind: if you have finished the Codecademy Python course, you know enough about Python and programming to use this library. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see how a game made with Ludema looks, here is [a simple level of the classic Sokoban](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xrYwZat2sw0Tni/source.gif). [The source code for this program](https://github.com/joaquinlpereyra/ludema/blob/master/sokoban.py) is less than a 100 lines of code long after stripping comments! \r\n\r\n# Why should I use Ludema?\r\n\r\nLudema rides you of the most common complications when programming a game and leaves you to code only the fun parts. You get to decide the storyline, characters, challenges, enemies, maps and levels! Ludema only helps you by providing:\r\n\r\n* A dead simple way of creating maps.\r\n* Predefined but easily customizable classes for your Player, NPCs, Items and other Pieces.\r\n* Easy interfaces to make pieces move and attack. Creating your own is easy too! \r\n* Turns are automagically implemented to make enemies and other entities respond to the player.\r\n* Clear exceptions that make it obvious where the problem was.\r\n* Emphasis on documentation: a method isn't a method until it has a clear and complete docstring. \r\n",
